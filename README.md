## Happy Halloween!

What is this?

This is an Angular project that uses P5JS to show a pumpkin for Halloween! P5JS is a very cool library that lets you do lots of different kinds of media and animations.

You can see a hosted instance of this application [here](https://halloween-javascript.firebaseapp.com).

The processing sketch that this is based on was [found here](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/169302/). The original sketch was in Java and I converted it to JavaScript.

Check out more examples of P5JS sketches [on their site here](https://p5js.org/).
